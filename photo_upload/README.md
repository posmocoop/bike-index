# Photo Upload
Automated, but verified by humans


## User Story
## Before using the Photo Upload Tool (PUT)
User chooses a route of the "Velovorzugsroutennetz" (e.g. Wollishofenâ€“Tiefenbrunnen, 7.7km) on the expert view (wrench icon) on index.velobserver.ch. He rodes along this route by taking photos. 

Minimum: 6 photos per km (more is always possible) 
Single Photo size between 3-4 MB.
EXIF data: timestamp, lat,lon of the photo

## Using the Photo Upload Tool (PUT)
In the expert view, the user can upload one or more photos per route.        
Timestamp, orig_lat, orig_lon are extracted from the image.        
           
Photos are resized and resampled (360x240) for the mobile version (Desktop version?), the original photo is kept.  
The suffix 360x240 is added to the resized and resampled image.        

Photos are positioned via pins on the edge. We keep orig_lon, orig_lat and then project and position pins on the route (pin_lon, pin_lat). Pins can only be moved along the route.     

If you click the pin, you see the photo and a "Verify"-Button underneath. If you click "Verify", the pin is fixed and the photo becomes available and the following data is shown and remains editable (Edit/Save Button). 

(timestamp) as DD.MM.YYYY, HH:MM, e.g. 19.1.2022, 15:20 
pin_lat, pin_lon
edge_id
street_name 
(street_number)
(neighborhood?)
city

## Constraints
- One image per edge (?) - so that we do not have an old image and a new image after infrastructure changes
- Always the newest photo is shown on index

## On index.velobserver.ch
The bbox of the map is centered on the pin, the full edge is shown


## Tools
- imagemagick (rokka?)
